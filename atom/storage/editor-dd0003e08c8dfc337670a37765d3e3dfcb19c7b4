Here is what\nyou need to know.\n\n1. Atom is free during the beta period. To help us improve the editor, Atom\n   sends anonymous usage information to Google Analytics. See\n   [atom/metrics](https://github.com/atom/metrics) for details on what\n   information is tracked and how to disable the metrics package.\n\n2. If you only remember one thing make it `cmd-shift-P`. This keystroke toggles\n   the command palette, which lists every Atom command. Yes, you can try it now!\n   Press `cmd-shift-P`, type `markdown` and press enter. It will trigger the\n  `markdown-preview:show` command which renders this text to HTML.\n\n3. We want your feedback! If you have anything positive or negative to say click\n   on the `Send Feedback` button at the bottom right of this window.\n\n4. Here is where you can get more help with Atom\n\n   * The [Atom docs](https://www.atom.io/docs) contain Guides and the API\n     reference.\n   * Discuss Atom at [discuss.atom.io](http://discuss.atom.io).\n   * The [Atom Org](https://github.com/atom). This is where all GitHub created Atom\n     packages can be found.\n\n5. If you ever want to see this buffer again use the command palette\n   (`cmd-shift-P`) and search for `Welcome`.\n","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[0,0],[0,0]],"tailed":false,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":65},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[],"deserializer":"History"},"filePath":"/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/welcome/lib/welcome.md","modifiedWhenLastPersisted":false,"digestWhenLastPersisted":"fe69723699a21cce7d610fa6a19bb2e4ad57b5c2","deserializer":"TextBuffer"}],"deserializer":"Project"},"workspace":{"paneContainer":{"root":{"items":[{"id":65,"softTabs":true,"displayBuffer":{"id":66,"softWrap":false,"editorWidthInChars":77,"scrollTop":0,"scrollLeft":0,"tokenizedBuffer":{"bufferPath":"/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/welcome/lib/welcome.md","tabLength":2,"deserializer":"TokenizedBuffer"},"deserializer":"DisplayBuffer"},"deserializer":"Editor"}],"activeItemUri":"/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/welcome/lib/welcome.md","focused":true,"active":true,"deserializer":"Pane"},"deserializer":"PaneContainer"},"fullScreen":false,"deserializer":"Workspace"},"packageStates":{"fuzzy-finder":{"/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/welcome/lib/welcome.md":1398475382673},"keybinding-resolver":{"attached":false},"metrics":{"sessionLength":19421},"tree-view":{"directoryExpansionStates":{},"selectedPath":"/Users/brownlee","hasFocus":false,"attached":true,"scrollLeft":0,"scrollTop":0,"width":200}}}
